# Forward

A long-term project with the goal to translate natural language into a programming language.


## Version 0.0.2

Versions before 0.1.0 are incomplete and therefore undeployable.

You can find syntax and versioning information by reading the `syntax.txt` file.


If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, read `todo.txt`
## How to use:

* Clone the repository with `https://github.com/Delpreti/Forward.git`

* CD into the new directory with `cd Forward`

* Compile with `make`

* Run the `conv` file. This will translate `texto.txt` into the `program.cpp` file.
